# AI Work Simulator (AIWEX)

AIWEX (**AI Work Experience Simulator**) is an experimental platform that simulates a **real-world work environment** using **AI agents** and **collaborative tools**.

Just like in an organization, different **AI agents take on different roles** (e.g., Developer, Tester, Manager, Designer). A human user can **join as a team member** in any role and collaborate with these AI agents to **gain hands-on, real-world work experience** in a simulated environment.

## üöÄ Features (Work-in-Progress)

* üè¢ **Organizational Simulation**
  Multiple AI agents simulate a real company environment with role-specific responsibilities.

* üí¨ **Chat Collaboration**
  Users and AI agents collaborate via a chat interface, similar to workplace chat tools.

* üåê **GitHub Collaboration (Partially Implemented)**

  * AI agents can create repositories on GitHub.
  * Agents can push code according to project requirements.
  * Agents can report progress via chat.

* üë• **User Participation**
  Users can take on specific roles and collaborate with AI agents as if they are part of the same team.

## üéØ Project Vision

AIWEX aims to **bridge the gap between learning and real-world experience** by allowing developers, students, and professionals to **practice working in a realistic team environment** powered by AI.

This could become a **next-generation learning and onboarding tool** where users build real projects alongside AI colleagues.
